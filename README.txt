# Description
This module will let you populate a webform select component with data from a
view. 

# Usage
## Creating the View
- Create a new view
- Create a "Webform Options" display
- Select the Webform Select List format
- Add the fields you want to use as key and value
- Filter and sort as needed
- In the format settings, select the field to use as key and value.

## Using the View
Add the select component to your webform and pick your view under "Load a 
Pre-Built Option List".

# Caveat
Please keep in mind that the list that will loaded on demand from the view is
not a hard coded list. When the webform is viewed, the component will get its
data directly from the view.

Also note that you can no longer see the item in the webform results when the
item is removed from the View results.
